            <p class="description">With its "best of class" combination of speed, power and spin, the Pure Aero is one
                of the most popular and versatile rackets ever made. Although it is weighted for intermediate players,
                this racket's outstanding playability and easy acceleration lend it an appeal that cuts across ability
                levels and stroke styles. For 2022, in addition to a more arm-friendly flex point, Babolat adds comfort
                with NF² Technology, which uses flax inserts in the handle and upper hoop to soften ball impact. Babolat
                also updates its FSI Spin technology with slightly tighter string spacing. The result is greater control
                when maximizing stroke speed and loading the ball with spin.</p>

            <p class="description">The latest update to the Speed MP doubles down on the outstanding feel, quick
                handing and controllable power that has long defined the Speed franchise. With its classic straight beam
                and sub 65-RA, the Speed MP 2022 delivers outstanding ball feedback. It also feels solid against pace
                while possessing the needed speed for hitting shots on the run or staying active at net. Compared to the
                Speed Pro, this stick is not only lighter and faster, it also packs a more modern and spin-friendly
                string pattern. For 2022, Head keeps Graphene 360+ which combines the stability and power of Graphene
                360 with SpiralFibers in the lower head for a cleaner feel at impact. Head also adds a uniquely flexible
                Auxetic construction in the yoke, which calibrates ball feedback to impact force. </p>

            <p class="description">Introducing the Shift Pro! With this racket Wilson releases the official cosmetic
                version of the Wilson Labs Project Shift 99 315, a prototype released in February of 2023. Featuring a
                639 cm² head and a surgical 18x20 string pattern, the Shift 99 Pro packs enough weight to comfortably
                redirect higher levels of pace while also offering plenty of pop to those who can leverage its mass.
                Despite having a tight pattern, the Shift Pro has impressive spin-potential, making it easier to control
                shot trajectory from the baseline and at net. As with the lighter Shift 99, this racket's graphite
                fibers have been engineered to help the frame bend in ways that compliment the explosive mechanics of
                the modern game. </p>

            <h3 class="title">yonex vcore 95</h3>
            <p class="description">Yonex makes impressive changes to the VCORE 95 one of the game's most user-friendly
                midsize rackets. Like the previous generation, this stick is fast and surgical, and it rewards seasoned
                ball strikers with an extremely precise ball. Although not as heavy and stable as a traditional player's
                racket, the VCORE 95 feels remarkably solid for its speedy sub-325 swingweight. For 2023 Yonex
                reengineers the frame's geometry. In addition to redesigning the shaft and making the beam's face
                thinner, Yonex has widened the surface area of the racket's upper hoop, resulting in a more stable,
                powerful and spin-friendly hitting experience. Other new features include SIF Grommets, which deploys a
                silicone oil infusion to reduce the friction between the string and grommet. The upshot is greater
                string movement for increased snapback and easier access to spin. Yonex has also lowered the RA, giving
                this stick even better feedback than previous versions. As with the previous generation, this racket has
                2-NAMD FlexForce Graphite in the upper shaft and lower hoop, enabling the racket to deflect and snapback
                effectively through impact.</p>

            <p class="description">Updated with a slightly softer feel for 2023, the FX 500 is ideal for aggressive
                players looking to load the ball with pace and spin. At 300 grams (unstrung), this racket is not only
                suitable for intermediate players, but it should also tempt the more advanced ball striker who wants a
                speedy option. Compared to the FX 500 Tour, this racket has a slightly larger head and thicker beam. As
                a result it has a tad more power, but it still packs enough precision for ambitious targeting. For 2023
                the FX 500 gets a more flexible beam, giving it a softer, more arm-friendly response than the previous
                generation. Dunlop has also tweaked the grommet system to help the string bed return greater energy to
                the ball (think power). As with the previous generation, the FX 500 benefits from Sonic Core
                w/Infinergy, which is added to the upper hoop to soften the feel of impact. Additional features include
                a Power Boost Frame Geometry which combines a speedy aerodynamic profile with a wider throat for
                stability.</p>

            <p class="description">Introducing the Whiteout 305 18x20! With this racket, Solinco gives experienced
                players an extremely precise weapon. In addition to its 98 square inch head and 21.7 mm straight beam
                this stick packs an 18x20 string pattern, giving it an extremely predictable, laser-like trajectory. The
                upshot is a racket that lets you pull the trigger and target the lines without having to worry about
                over hitting. Technologies include 40T Carbon Fiber at 3/9 o'clock, resulting in a larger sweetspot and
                greater torsional stability. The feel is further enhanced by Liquid Crystal Technology which is added to
                the layup in order to reduce vibrations and lighten the load on your tendons. The Whiteout 305 18x20
                also benefits from Foam Technology in the head, giving it a wonderfully solid feel through impact.</p>

                on the run or charging into the front court and finishing points. For 2023, the string bed gets updated
                with Tecnifibre's ISOFLEX System which creates a more forgiving and consistent feeling string bed. Other
                features include Tecnifibre's innovative RS Section Beam, which combines square and elliptical shapes to

                the adidas Barricade Clay has been updated with even more comfort and a flexible feel, while maintaining
                the protection where it is needed most. A key feature carried on from previous Barricades is the Torsion
                System, which creates a very stable ride and will hold up to the most aggressive changes of direction.
                This update features an asymmetric hidden lacing system, which provides secure lockdown and keeps the
                laces protected on the medial side for hard court sliders. The comfort has been enhanced with foam pods
                in the heel region for step-in comfort, as well as the full length BOUNCE 2.0 midsole for those players
                putting in the long hours on court. The durability has been increased due to the adituff recycled
                material placed at the toe and medial side of the shoe, and the outsole is formed with a full
                herringbone tread pattern for maximum grip on clay courts.</p>

            <p class="description">Building on the success of the previous version (Wave Exceed Tour 4), this Wave
                Exceed Tour 5 Clay is even lighter than before, providing an explosive feel, and a high level of
                comfort. New to this version is the Enerzy technology, giving more rebound into your step to help
                maximize foot speed. The upper material is very light, and flexible to enhance the comfort, while also
                providing plenty of ventilation. Mizuno's DuRubber outsole is resistant to the wear and tear, and for
                this version is molded into a defined herringbone tread pattern, to help maximize the grip on clay
                courts.</p>
